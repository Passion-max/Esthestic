NFTs are bought and sold online, often with cryptocurrency, and they can be traded just like any other asset.</p><h5>Key Benefits of NFTs</h5><ol><li>Uniqueness: NFTs are unique and cannot be replicated. This makes them ideal for representing ownership of digital assets.</li><li>Immutability: NFTs are stored on a blockchain, which is a secure and transparent ledger. This makes them tamper-proof and ensures that ownership records are always accurate.</li><li>Scarcity: NFTs can be scarce, which can drive up their value. This is similar to how physical collectibles, such as baseball cards, can be valuable.</li><li>Liquidity: NFTs can be bought and sold on exchanges, which makes them liquid assets. This means that they can be easily converted into cash, which can be a benefit for investors.</li></ol><h5>Risks Associated with NFTs</h5><ol><li>Fraud: There have been cases of fraud in the NFT market, such as people selling fake NFTs or using stolen artwork to create NFTs.</li><li>Volatility: The price of NFTs can be volatile, which means that they can lose value quickly.

However, there are also some risks associated with NFTs, such as fraud and volatility. Investors should be aware of these risks before investing in NFTs.</p></div>"
